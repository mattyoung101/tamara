= Results
== Applying TaMaRa to simple circuits
- This section will mostly contain circuit diagrams of the TaMaRa algorithm applied to various circuits, and
  descriptions of what it has done

=== Combinatorial circuits

=== Multi-bit combinatorial circuits

=== Sequential circuits

=== Multi-cone circuits

=== Feedback circuits

== Formal verification
=== Equivalence checking
- Unsure how to systematically show equivalence checking results?
- Maybe by the numbers?

=== Fault injection
- Description of fault injection setup, some circuit diagrams, and proof that it passes the formal
  verification

=== Multi-bit fault injection studies
- Graph
  - X axis: Number of faults
  - Y axis: Passing test cases #sym.div Number of cells in the circuit

== RTL fuzzing
- Unsure how to show this systematically either

== Applying TaMaRa to advanced circuits
- CPU design if applicable
