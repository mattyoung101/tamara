I would like to specially and individually thank these members of the YosysHQ team for their extremely
valuable help and guidance throughout the project: N. Engelhardt, George Rennie, Emil J. Tywoniak, Krystine
Sherwin, Catherine "whitequark", and Jannis Harder. I would also like to extend this gratitude to all of the
contributors to Yosys and the YosysHQ team - without their hard work, this thesis would not be possible. I
would also like to thank my supervisor Assoc. Prof. John Williams for his excellent support and guidance
during this thesis. Additionally, I would like to thank the team at Sandia National Laboratories for their
interest in this project and its outcomes.

I would also like to thank my friends: Ethan, James, Annie, Sarah, Henry, Ellis. Thank you for listening to
me, and it was a pleasure working with you all, the best of luck in your own theses too.

Last but not least, let me thank my mum Jeanette for her unwavering support throughout this project, and for
putting in the effort to understand my incomprehensible yapping. It means a lot to me.
