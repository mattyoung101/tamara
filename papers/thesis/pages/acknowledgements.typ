I would like to thank my supervisor Assoc. Prof. John Williams for his support and guidance during this
thesis. I would also like to extend my gratitude to N. Engelhardt of YosysHQ, and the team at Sandia National
Laboratories, for their interest and support. Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to all of the
contributors to Yosys - without their hard work, this thesis would not be possible.
