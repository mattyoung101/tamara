= Acknowledgements
I would like to specially and individually thank these members of the YosysHQ team for their extremely
valuable help and guidance throughout the project: N. Engelhardt, George Rennie, Emil J. Tywoniak, Krystine
Sherwin, Catherine "whitequark", and Jannis Harder. I would also like to extend this gratitude to all of the
contributors to Yosys and the YosysHQ team - without their hard work, this thesis would not be possible. I
would also like to thank my supervisor Assoc. Prof. John Williams for his excellent support and guidance
during this thesis. Additionally, I would like to thank the team at Sandia National Laboratories for their
interest in this project and its outcomes.
