If successful, OpenROAD will help realize the IDEA goal of "democratization of hardware design", by reducing cost, expertise, schedule and risk barriers that confront system designers today. Several novel technical directions follow directly from the IDEA program's 24-hour, no-humans goals. These include (i) enablement of pervasive machine learning in and around design tools and flows, (ii) parallel search and optimization to exploit available cloud resources, (iii) partitioning and problem decomposition to reduce solution latency, and (iv) layout generation methodologies that provide "freedoms from choice" without undue loss of design quality. Further, the development of open-source, self-driving design tools is in and of itself a "moon shot" with numerous technical and cultural challenges.},

Yosys is built as an extensible framework so it can be used easily as basis for custom synthesis flows and as environment for the implementation and research on new synthesis algorithms. Yosys has special emphasis on support for coarsegrain logic, making it ideal for algorithms such as logic mapping to DSP cells in FPGAs or synthesis for custom coarse-grain reconfigurable hardware. Yosys has mature support for Verilog HDL and is able to synthesize complex real-world Verilog designs. Example design flows for fine-grain and coarse-grain architectures are presented and discussed. The availability of Yosys under a liberal open source license can greatly improve reproducibility of scientific publications, when Yosys is used as basis for reference implementations of new algorithms instead of closed-source alternatives.},

For FPGA systems that employ configuration scrubbing, majority voters are needed in all feedback paths to ensure proper synchronization between the TMR replicates. Synchronization voters, however, consume additional resources and impact system timing. This paper will introduce and contrast four algorithms for inserting synchronization voters while automatically performing TMR. The area cost and timing impact of each algorithm on a number of circuit benchmarks will be reported. This paper will demonstrate that one of the algorithms provides the best overall timing performance results with an average 9.8% increase in critical path length over a triplicated design without voters. Another algorithm provides far better area results at a slightly higher timing cost (an average 2.1% area increase over a triplicated design without voters).},

A setup composed of a soft-core processor and a matrix multiplication design protected by TMR and embedded into an SRAM-based FPGA was analyzed under accumulated bit-flips in its configuration memory bits. Different configurations using single and multiple input and output workload data streams were tested. Results show that by using a coarse grain TMR with triplicated inputs, voters, and outputs, it is possible to reach 95{\%} of reliability by accumulating up to 61 bit-flips and 99{\%} of reliability by accumulating up to 17 bit-flips in the configuration memory bits. These numbers imply in a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of the coarse grain TMR at ground level from 50{\%} to 70{\%} higher than the MTBF of the unhardened version for the same reliability confidence.},
